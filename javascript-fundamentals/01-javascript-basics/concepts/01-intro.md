# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** primarily used to make web pages **interactive, dynamic, and functional**. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the **core technologies of the World Wide Web**.

---

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **client-side scripting language** that runs in the browser, allowing developers to control how web pages behave in response to user actions such as clicks, typing, scrolling, or form submissions.

Today, JavaScript is no longer limited to browsers. With modern runtimes, it is also used for:

- Backend development
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Game development
- Automation and scripting

---

## Why JavaScript is Important

- It enables **dynamic content updates** without reloading pages
- It allows **real-time user interaction**
- It is supported by **all modern browsers**
- It has a **massive ecosystem** of libraries and frameworks
- It is used across **frontend, backend, and full-stack development**

## Key Features of JavaScript

- **Interpreted Language** – Executes line by line without compilation
- **Dynamically Typed** – Variable types are determined at runtime
- **Event-Driven** – Responds to user actions and events
- **Prototype-Based** – Uses prototypes instead of classical inheritance
- **Single-Threaded** – Executes code in a single main thread
- **Asynchronous Support** – Handles async tasks using callbacks, promises, and async/await

---

## Where JavaScript Runs

- **Web Browsers** (Frontend)
- **Server Environments** (Backend)
- **Mobile & Desktop Applications**
- **Command Line Tools**

---

## What You Can Build with JavaScript

- Interactive websites and web applications
- REST APIs and backend services
- Real-time applications (chat, notifications)
- Mobile apps (Android / iOS)
- Desktop applications
- Browser extensions

---

## Conclusion

JavaScript is a **versatile and powerful language** that has evolved from a simple scripting tool into a **full-fledged programming language** used across multiple platforms. Mastering JavaScript is essential for modern software and web development.
